# .NET & C# Learning Progress Report

**Student:** Viking  
**Effective Time Spent:** ~2 hours  
**Topic:** Custom Endpoints & Route Parameters  
**Lesson:** 02 - Custom Endpoints & Route Parameters  
**Milestone:** 1 - REST API Foundation *(71% complete after this session)*

---

## Session Context

**Previous Session:** [Lesson 01 - Web API Basics](20260131-report.md)  
**Capstone Goal:** Build a real-time chat application (WebChat) demonstrating full-stack .NET development  
**This Session's Role:** Core CRUD operations—the foundation for the WebChat's rooms and messages API

---

## Objectives Completed ✅

- [x] Add a custom GET endpoint with a route parameter (`/hello/{name}`)
- [x] Add a POST endpoint that accepts JSON body data
- [x] Understand HTTP methods in ASP.NET Core (MapGet, MapPost, MapDelete)
- [x] Return different response types (string, JSON, status codes)

---

## Environment Setup

| Component | Version/Details |
|-----------|-----------------|
| .NET SDK | 10.0 |
| OS | macOS |
| IDE | VS Code |
| Terminal | zsh |
| Testing | curl |

**Key Learning:** Learned to use curl with POST requests (`-X POST`, `-H "Content-Type: application/json"`, `-d '...'`), and `-i` flag to inspect HTTP response headers.

---

## Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Route Parameters
- Successfully implemented `/hello/{name}` endpoint
- Understood that `{placeholder}` in route binds to matching parameter name
- Correctly identified that parameter names must match between route and handler
- Demonstrated understanding when intentionally mismatched `{name}` with `string person`

### 2. Model Binding & JSON Handling
- Understood the difference between simple types (query string) vs complex types (request body)
- Created appropriate records for request/response: `MessageRequest`, `MessageResponse`, `ItemName`, `Item`
- Successfully debugged the "was not provided from query string" error independently
- Correctly extracted nested properties (`itemName.Name`) when creating objects

### 3. HTTP Methods & Status Codes
- Implemented `MapGet`, `MapPost`, `MapDelete` endpoints
- Used `Results.Ok()` and `Results.NotFound()` for proper status codes
- Understood 404 = Not Found, 200 = OK
- Applied pattern: check if resource exists → return appropriate status

### 4. In-Memory CRUD Operations
Built complete CRUD for items:
```csharp
app.MapGet("/items", () => items);
app.MapGet("/items/{id}", (int id) => { /* with 404 handling */ });
app.MapPost("/items", (ItemName itemName) => { /* create & add */ });
app.MapDelete("/items/{id}", (int id) => { /* remove with 404 handling */ });
```

---

## Problem-Solving Demonstrated

1. **Parameter Name Mismatch:** When testing `{name}` with `string person`, correctly hypothesized there would be an error. Built understanding through experimentation.

2. **Simple vs Complex Type Binding:** Diagnosed the "query string" error by connecting it to the `/echo` solution—recognized the pattern and applied the fix (create a record).

3. **Nested Object Bug:** Identified the `{"name":{"name":"hat"}}` issue in output, understood the cause (passing wrong type), and fixed by extracting `itemName.Name` as a string.

4. **String Interpolation:** Caught the missing `$` prefix when output was literal `{newItem.Id}` instead of the actual value.

## Connections to Prior Knowledge

The student effectively leveraged experience with:
- **HTTP APIs** - Solid understanding of REST concepts, HTTP methods, and when to use each
- **curl** - Already familiar with GET requests, quickly learned POST syntax
- **Object-Oriented Concepts** - Understood records as "shapes" for data, similar to interfaces/types in other languages

---

## Student Attitude & Engagement

### Emotional State
- **Energy Level:** High - Engaged throughout, moved at good pace
- **Curiosity:** Asked thoughtful questions about route vs query parameters, wanted to understand "why" not just "how"
- **Persistence:** Worked through multiple bugs independently with minimal hints
- **Confidence:** Appropriately calibrated - tried things, asked when stuck, acknowledged when concepts were fresh

### Session Dynamics
Student was focused and methodical. Each exercise built naturally on the previous. When encountering errors, approached them analytically rather than getting frustrated. Showed good self-awareness at the end, noting concepts are "fresh" and may need reinforcement—this is healthy metacognition.

### Compared to Previous Sessions
Consistent with Lesson 01's strong performance. Continues to show excellent transfer of knowledge from other frameworks and languages. Debugging skills remain a strength.

---

## Historical Patterns

### Growth Since Last Session
- Moved from reading existing code to writing new endpoints from scratch
- Now comfortable with the request/response cycle in ASP.NET
- Expanded from single endpoint to full CRUD operations

### Recurring Themes
- **Strength:** Pattern recognition—sees a concept once, applies it elsewhere (echo → items POST)
- **Strength:** Self-correction through experimentation (intentionally breaking things to learn)
- **Watch:** Prefers moving forward; may need explicit review sessions to solidify "fresh" concepts

### Trajectory
Accelerating. Lesson 02 was completed faster than Lesson 01 with more complex material. Student is building momentum.

---

## Areas for Continued Learning

- Input validation (what happens with bad data?)
- Error handling beyond 404 (400 Bad Request, etc.)
- PUT endpoint for updates (completes CRUD)
- Understanding `Results.Created()` with location headers

---

## Assessment

### Understanding Level

| Objective | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Route parameters | ✅ Strong | Implemented correctly, understood binding |
| POST with JSON body | ✅ Strong | Debugged binding issue, created proper records |
| HTTP methods | ✅ Strong | Used GET/POST/DELETE appropriately |
| Response types | ✅ Strong | Used Results.Ok/NotFound, understood status codes |

### Concerns

None significant. Student acknowledged concepts are fresh—recommend brief review at start of Lesson 03 to reinforce before adding new complexity.

---

## Summary

Excellent session. Viking completed all four objectives and built a functional in-memory CRUD API. Demonstrated strong debugging skills when encountering model binding issues, nested object bugs, and string interpolation mistakes. The session showed good pattern recognition—solutions from earlier exercises were applied to later ones. Ready for Lesson 03.

---

## Path Forward

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Next Lesson:** 03 - Input Validation & Error Handling
2. **Why This:** Current endpoints accept any input—real APIs need validation. This completes Milestone 1 and prepares for the capstone's message validation.
3. **Adjusted Approach:** Start with 5-minute review of today's concepts (route params, model binding) before introducing new material.

### Milestone Progress
- **Current Milestone:** 1 - REST API Foundation
- **Skills Completed:** 5/7 (Project scaffolding, Minimal API routing, Route parameters, HTTP methods, Request/response JSON)
- **Estimated Sessions to Milestone:** 1 more lesson
- **On Track?** Yes - ahead of expected pace

### Maintaining Positive Momentum
Student is building confidence through hands-on success. Continue the exercise-driven approach. The CRUD exercise was particularly effective—consider similar "build something complete" challenges. Acknowledge their debugging wins; it's a genuine strength.

### Long-term Trajectory
Strong progress toward Milestone 1 completion. After Lesson 03, student will be ready for the first **Capstone Sprint**—building the WebChat's basic rooms/messages API using all Milestone 1 skills. This will be an excellent opportunity to synthesize learning.

**Bottom Line:** Viking is progressing quickly with solid fundamentals, excellent debugging instincts, and appropriate self-awareness about what needs reinforcement.
