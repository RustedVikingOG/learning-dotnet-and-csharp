# .NET & C# Learning Progress Report

**Student:** Viking
**Effective Time Spent:** ~2 hours
**Topic:** WebChat API (Capstone Sprint)
**Lesson:** Capstone Milestone 1
**Milestone:** 1 - REST API Foundation (COMPLETED) 🎉

---

## Session Context

**Previous Session:** Lesson 03 - Input Validation & Error Handling
**Capstone Goal:** Build a real-time chat application (WebChat)
**This Session's Role:** Applying all Milestone 1 skills to build the foundation of the WebChat API (Rooms & Messages).

---

## Objectives Completed ✅

- [x] **Project Setup:** Created `WebChatApi` (Minimal API).
- [x] **Resource: Rooms:** Implemented `GET` (list/single), `POST`, `DELETE`.
- [x] **Resource: Messages:** Implemented `GET` (by room), `POST`.
- [x] **Logic & Validation:**
    - Validated inputs (empty names/text).
    - Handled "Parent Not Found" (message for non-existent room).
    - Handled edge cases (empty lists).
- [x] **Refactoring:** Improved `Delete` logic to use cleaner `Find -> Check -> Remove` pattern.
- [x] **Deployment:** Shipped code to `main` via PR.

## Concepts Demonstrated

### 1. Minimal API Independence
Student successfully scaffolded the project and endpoints without step-by-step hand-holding. The structure was clean and followed best practices learned in lessons 1-3.

### 2. Logic & Debugging
- **Initial Bug:** `rooms.Remove(rooms.FirstOrDefault(...))` caused a warning. Student understood *why* (potential null) and refactored it to check for null first.
- **Return Types:** Encountered compiler errors with mixed return types (`Room` vs `IResult`). Understood the fix: explicitly wrap success responses in `Results.Ok(...)`.

### 3. Git Workflow
- Successfully navigated the `feat` -> `PR` -> `Main` workflow.
- Handled mixed file states using `git stash` and branching strategies (guided).

## Assessment

### Understanding Level

| Objective | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| CRUD Operations | ✅ Strong | Implemented all resources correctly. |
| Input Validation | ✅ Strong | consistently applied `IsNullOrWhiteSpace` checks. |
| Error Handling | ✅ Strong | Correctly used 404 vs 400. |
| C# Records | ✅ Strong | Used `record` for DTOs effectively. |

### Concerns
None. The compilation errors were minor syntax/minimal-api quirks that were quickly resolved.

---

## Summary

Milestone 1 is **COMPLETE**. Viking has proven the ability to build a standard REST API with in-memory data. The "WebChat" project now exists and has functional chat rooms and messaging capabilities (ephemeral). The foundation is solid for adding a real database in Milestone 2.

---

## Path Forward

### Immediate Next Steps
1.  **Next Session:** Lesson 04 - Entity Framework Core Basics.
2.  **Why This:** The chat data disappears when the server stops. We need a database!
3.  **Topic:** Installing EF Core, setting up a `DbContext`, and In-Memory DB (stepping stone to SQLite).

### Milestone Progress
- **Milestone 1:** 100% ✅
- **Milestone 2:** Starting... 🚀

**Bottom Line:** The API works. Now let's make it remember things.
